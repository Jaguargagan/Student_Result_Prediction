# Student-Graduation-Result-Prediction
"Predicts student graduation outcomes using ML, helping institutions identify at-risk students for timely support, improving graduation rates, and enhancing educational experiences."

## Overview

The "Student Graduation Result Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts students' graduation results based on various factors and features. It involves data preprocessing, model selection, training and evaluation, and the deployment of a predictive model. This project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to set up your environment correctly. This typically involves installing Python and the necessary libraries. You can install the required dependencies by following the instructions provided in the `requirements.txt` file. Use a package manager like `pip` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Start by preparing your dataset. Ensure it contains relevant features and the target variable, which in this case is the graduation result you want to predict.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before applying machine learning models, preprocess the data. This may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose from a list of machine learning models provided in the project. Train and evaluate each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models to optimize their performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different models using suitable evaluation metrics to determine which one provides the best predictions for graduation results.

6. **Deployment**: After selecting the best model, deploy it for real-world predictions. Create an interface or application that takes input data and returns predicted graduation results.

## Project Structure

The project's files and directories are organized as follows:

- `data.csv`: This is the dataset used in the project.
- `Student_Gradution_Result_Prediction.ipynb`: Contains the full code and machine learning models used in the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Data

Your dataset should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure that it includes relevant features, such as student academic records and related information, along with the target variable (graduation results) you want to predict. The code will load and preprocess this data.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step. It involves tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. Ensure your dataset is prepared correctly before training machine learning models.

## Modeling

Modeling involves selecting machine learning algorithms from a predefined list within the project. Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated using appropriate classification metrics. This step helps identify the best model for predicting graduation results.

## Deployment

To make predictions in real-world scenarios, deploy the selected model. You can create a user-friendly interface or application that takes input data related to a student and provides the predicted graduation result.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. You can contribute by reporting issues, suggesting improvements, enhancing documentation, or adding new features. Please follow the project's guidelines and adhere to a standard code of conduct.
